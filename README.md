# QLik Technical Assessment

This repository contains the solutions for the QLik Technical Assessment, divided into three exercises. Each exercise demonstrates specific Java programming concepts, including deadlocks, memory leaks, and CPU consumption, along with methods to analyze and resolve them.

---

## Structure

The repository is organized into three separate projects:

1. [Exercise 1: Java Thread Deadlock and Analysis](exercise1_deadlock/)
   - Demonstrates a deadlock situation in multithreading, steps to retrieve a thread dump, and analysis of deadlocks.

2. [Exercise 2: Java Memory Leak and Analysis](exercise2_memory_leak/)
   - Simulates a memory leak in Java, explains how to retrieve and analyze a heap dump, and discusses strategies to avoid memory leaks.

3. [Exercise 3: CPU Consumption Implementation and Analysis](exercise3_high_cpu_consumption/)
   - Demonstrates high CPU usage caused by inefficient code, with steps to monitor and analyze CPU consumption.

## Repository Overview

Each exercise includes:
- Source code for the implementation.
- A detailed README explaining the problem, solution, and analysis steps.
